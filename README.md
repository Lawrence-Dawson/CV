Having trained as a dancer from the age of 4, leaving home at the age of 11 to attend The Royal Ballet School, then graduating at a professional standard from Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, I realised, by the age of 22, that my passion for dance had faded. I went on to travel through Asia solo then work in hospitality, gaining invaluable work experience, fine tuning my communication skills, learning to work well under pressure, and as part of a small team, not forgetting perfecting the art of the perfect 'Espresso Martini'.

So why turn to code? It's a far cry from dance and bartending I hear you saying. Well I've always been interested in tech and gadgets, from a young age I was constantly taking things apart, my dads digital clock, remote control cars, the house stereo, all in an effort to understand how they worked. That curiosity later developed into a passion for fixing things, my Xbox, laptop, iphone, tills at work. I wanted to go into a profession that satisfied this itch, I also wanted to break the cycle of working in professions that are oversubscribed, where employees are often undervalued and underpaid.
A good friend of mine is a developer and suggested I look into coding, one beginners Java course at City University later, and I was hooked, but hopelessly aware of how little I knew. I applied to Makers Academy, Europe's No.1 coding bootcamp, and got in, it's the best decision I've ever made.

### Skills

#### Strong work ethic

- When I asked my colleagues at Makers Academy what my key attributes were, a 'strong work ethic' came up time and time again.
- I hate to give up on something once I've started. I know that as a junior developer I'll often feel like the dumbest guy in the room, but I'll be one of the first in and last to leave until that's no longer the case.

#### I learn by doing

- Dancers learn by doing, when tasked with something difficult they slow it down and repeat it over and over until it's mastered and its second nature. I've found learning code is much the same, I relish the chance to tackle a bug, or a problem, because it gives me the chance to tackle something in a different way over and over again, each time increasing my knowledge and understanding until I crack it.

#### Diverse background

- How many junior developers do you know that can teach you how to do a double pirouette and make a Cosmopolitan?

#### Communication

- While in hospitality I perfected my communication skills
 - Became comfortable talking to a total stranger
 - Forged strong relationships with customers
 - Handled complaints
 - Learned to work well in high stress environments as part of a team


- A 'great team player' according to my colleagues at Makers Academy.

- I'm a strong advocate of 'Extreme Programming', I believe a team or pair that work well together will nearly always out perform others that don't, regardless of technical ability.


#### Organisation

- Promoted to the role of bar manager at The Abingdon, tasked with training new staff, maintaining standards, stock management, and rota creation.
